Any application that logs to Loki can be discovered here:

Here we can view the log content for the selected `service_name`:

For example, we can select the `level` label, which will then append that to our LogQL query and present us with this view:

We can then include `error` for example and we will see all the error logs for our selected service:

We can then also select "Open in Explore" and our query will be pre-populated for us, eg. `{service_name="tempo-ingester", level="error"} | logfmt`:
